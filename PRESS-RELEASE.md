Booking Buddy

Take the hassle out of planning your trip!

When you are planning a trip with friends, use BookingBuddy to make the process easier.

Summary

BookingBuddy helps you collect all the ideas that your friends have about where to travel, how much to spend, when to go, and what activities they are interested in doing.  Booking Buddy's algorithm will sort through all that data and offer travel packages that meet the preferences of all the people involved in the trip.

Problem

Booking Buddy saves a lot of time and hassle related to planning a trip which can often be very time consuming and complicated as more and more people are involved in planning the trip.

How many times can you remember having to make many phone calls or meet in person to decide on what airline to fly, what dates work for everyone, how much everyone can afford.  This problem is exacerbated by the fact that travel deals are often fleeting and need to be grabbed right away, but a planner is hampered by the fact they need to get approval from all those going on the trip.

Solution

Booking Buddy provides a place for all trip goers to enter their preferences, discuss the options that match everyone's needs, they can bookmark their favorite options and everyone can vote on those options to help rank their top travel destinations.  The process repeats for activities so that decisions can be made quickly, efficiently, and a trip options are set for everyone before they pay for anything.

> This material was originally posted [here](http://www.quora.com/What-is-Amazons-approach-to-product-development-and-product-management). It is reproduced here for posterities sake.

There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

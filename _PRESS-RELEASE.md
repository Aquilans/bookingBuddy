Booking Buddy

Take the hassle out of planning your trip!

When you are planning a trip with friends, use BookingBuddy to make the process easier.

Summary

BookingBuddy helps you collect all the ideas that your friends have about where to travel, how much to spend, when to go, and what activities they are interested in doing.  Booking Buddy's algorithm will sort through all that data and offer travel packages that meet the preferences of all the people involved in the trip.

Problem

Booking Buddy saves a lot of time and hassle related to planning a trip which can often be very time consuming and complicated as more and more people are involved in planning the trip.

How many times can you remember having to make many phone calls or meet in person to decide on what airline to fly, what dates work for everyone, how much everyone can afford.  This problem is exacerbated by the fact that travel deals are often fleeting and need to be grabbed right away, but a planner is hampered by the fact they need to get approval from all those going on the trip.

Solution

Booking Buddy provides a place for all trip goers to enter their preferences, discuss the options that match everyone's needs, they can bookmark their favorite options and everyone can vote on those options to help rank their top travel destinations.  The process repeats for activities so that decisions can be made quickly, efficiently, and a trip options are set for everyone before they pay for anything.

Usage

Some usage instructions
If you choose to install yarn, follow these steps from your terminal:
`brew update`
`brew install yarn`
Locate and open your profile. This will either be `.profle`, `.bashrc`, or `.zshrc`. (For me it was the bashrc. It can be located in your root directory by using `ls -a`)
Add the following line to your profile.
export PATH="$PATH:`yarn global bin`"
Test that Yarn is running with `yarn --version`

Requirements

Node 0.10.x

Development

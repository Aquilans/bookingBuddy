## Development

### Installing Dependencies

If you choose to install yarn, follow these steps from within:
`brew update`
`brew install yarn`
Locate and open your profile. This will either be `.profle`, `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc`. (For me it was the bashrc. It can be located in your root directory by using `ls -a`)
Add the following line to your profile.
``export PATH="$PATH:`yarn global bin`"``
Test that Yarn is running with `yarn --version`
